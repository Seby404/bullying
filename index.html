        <h1>Stress Awareness</h1>
        <p>
            Stress is a common part of a teenager's life, often caused by academic pressure, social expectations, family issues, and the challenges of growing up. Balancing schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and friendships can feel overwhelming, leading to anxiety and frustration. Social media and peer pressure can add to the stress, making teens feel like they have to meet unrealistic standards. While some stress is normal, too much can affect mental and physical health. It's important for teenagers to find healthy ways to cope, like talking to someone they trust, practicing self-care, and taking breaks when needed.
